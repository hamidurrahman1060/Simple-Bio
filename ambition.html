I have never neglected any opportunity for improvement. I always had immense liking towards English literature from childhood which motivated me to join ‘Speak Easy’, the literary club of my undergraduate college which conducted various activities in college like essay writing, debates, public speaking, role plays, group discussions etc. I presented a paper on ‘Google as a hacking tool’ at Quest, a national level technical symposium. I also presented a poster on ‘Cryptography’ at a national level technical fest. I contributed to the organization of many formal and informal events as a part of various fests held in my college and also actively participated in fests conducted by various colleges in my state.</p>
